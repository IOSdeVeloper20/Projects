# Clima - iOS Weather App

Clima is an iOS weather forecasting app built with Swift. It allows users to check the weather based on their current location using the iPhone's GPS data, or they can manually search for the weather in any city. The app features a clean, dark-mode-enabled interface and utilizes the OpenWeather API to provide real-time weather data.

- **Dark Mode**: A dark mode theme for a comfortable viewing experience.
- **Weather Icons**: Displays weather conditions using intuitive vector icons.
- **Location Services**: Uses Core Location to fetch and display the current weather based on the user’s GPS.
- **Real-Time Data**: Fetches weather data from the OpenWeather API and updates live.
